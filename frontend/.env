Dear [Recipient's Name],

I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to provide an update on the CIBN website revamp BRD that was previously shared with you.

After a thorough review and extensive research, I have identified the technology that will best suit our needs for a maintainable and upgradable website. I have made necessary revisions to the BRD document to reflect these recommendations.

Please find attached the updated BRD document for your review. I would appreciate it if you could take some time to review the changes and provide any feedback or suggestions you may have.

Thank you for your attention to this matter. If you have any questions or require further clarification, please do not hesitate to contact me.

Best regards,

Ismail Muhammed
